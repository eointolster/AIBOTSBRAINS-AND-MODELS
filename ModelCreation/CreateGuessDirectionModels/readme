Certainly! I'll create a README.md file that explains how to use the saved model file. This README will cover the basics of loading and using the saved model, as well as provide some context about the project.

Here's the content for your README.md file:

# Direction Prediction AI

This project implements a neural network that predicts the direction (angle) between two points on a 28x28 grid.

## Overview

The AI learns to predict the angle between a start point (red square) and an end point (green square) on a grid. The model is trained on randomly generated data points and can be saved for later use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Flask
- NumPy

## How to Use the Saved Model

After training the model using the web interface, you can save it by clicking the "Save Model" button. This creates a file named `direction_model.h5` in your project directory. Here's how you can use this saved model:

1. Load the model:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('direction_model.h5')
```

2. Make predictions:

```python
# Function to predict angle
def predict_angle(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y):
    input_data = np.array([[start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y]])
    predicted_angle = loaded_model.predict(input_data)
    return predicted_angle[0][0]

# Example usage
start_x, start_y = 0, 0
end_x, end_y = 27, 27
predicted_angle = predict_angle(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)
print(f"Predicted angle: {predicted_angle}")
```

3. Interpret the results:

The predicted angle is in radians. You can convert it to degrees if needed:

```python
import math

angle_degrees = math.degrees(predicted_angle)
print(f"Predicted angle in degrees: {angle_degrees}")
```

4. Visualize the prediction (optional):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_prediction(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, angle):
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
    plt.xlim(0, 28)
    plt.ylim(0, 28)
    plt.grid(True)
    
    plt.plot(start_x, start_y, 'ro', markersize=10)  # Start point
    plt.plot(end_x, end_y, 'go', markersize=10)  # End point
    
    # Plot the predicted direction
    length = 5  # Length of the direction line
    dx = length * math.cos(angle)
    dy = length * math.sin(angle)
    plt.arrow(start_x, start_y, dx, dy, head_width=0.5, head_length=0.7, fc='b', ec='b')
    
    plt.title(f"Predicted Angle: {math.degrees(angle):.2f} degrees")
    plt.show()

# Example usage
plot_prediction(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, predicted_angle)
```

## Notes

- The model predicts angles in radians, ranging from -π to π.
- The input to the model should be normalized to the range [0, 1] if you're using custom input that's not on the 28x28 grid.
- The accuracy of predictions may vary based on the amount and quality of training data.

## Further Improvements

- Experiment with different model architectures or hyperparameters.
- Implement data augmentation to improve generalization.
- Add functionality to continue training a loaded model with new data.
